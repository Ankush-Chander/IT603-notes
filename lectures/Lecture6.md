# Agenda
1. Variables and Basic Types
2. Memory management

### Variables
A variable provides us with **named storage** that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a type.  
The type determines:   
- the size and layout of the variable’s memory
- the range of values that can be stored within that memory
- the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

Data Types in C++ are mainly divided into 3 Types: 
1. **Primitive Data Types**: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 
2. **Derived Data Types**: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
3. **Abstract or User-Defined Data Types**: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:

| Datatype               | Description                                                                                   | Size    | Range                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| Integer                | The keyword used for integer data types is **int**.                                               | 4 bytes | -2147483648 to 2147483647             |
| Character              | Character data type is used for storing characters. The keyword used for the character data type is **char**. | 1 byte  | -128 to 127 or 0 to 255               |
| Boolean                | Boolean data type is used for storing Boolean or logical values. A Boolean variable can store either true or false. The keyword used for the Boolean data type is **bool**. | N/A     | true or false                         |
| Floating Point         | Floating Point data type is used for storing single-precision floating-point values or decimal values. The keyword used for the floating-point data type is **float**. | 4 bytes | N/A                                   |
| Double Floating Point  | Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double-precision floating-point values or decimal values. The keyword used for the double floating-point data type is **double**. | 8 bytes | N/A                                   |
| void                   | Void means without any value. void data type represents a valueless entity. A void data type is used for those functions which do not return a value. | N/A     | N/A                                   |
| Wide Character         | Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has a size greater than the normal 8-bit data type. Represented by **wchar_t**. | 2 or 4 bytes | N/A                                |


### Variable assignment
```c++
int sum = 0, value, // sum, value, and units_sold have type int
    units_sold = 0; // sum and units_sold have initial value 0
    
// ok: price is defined and initialized before it is used to initialize discount
double price = 109.99, discount = price * 0.16;
// ok: call applyDiscount and use the return value to initialize salePrice
double salePrice = applyDiscount(price, discount);
```

### Segmentation fault experiment
```c++
#include <iostream>

void causeSegmentationFault(int depth) {
    // function calls itself by appending the argument
    // note there is no stopping condition in the recursion, hence it will keep on calling itself forever.
    // thereby expanding stack
    std::cout << "Recursion depth: " << depth << std::endl;
    causeSegmentationFault(depth + 1); // Recursive call with increased depth
}

int main() {
    causeSegmentationFault(1); // Start the recursion
    return 0;
}

```

### How to choose data types?
- Use an unsigned type when you know that the values cannot be negative.
- Use `int` for integer arithmetic. `short` is usually too small and, in practice, `long` often has the same size as `int`. If your data values are larger than the minimum guaranteed size of an `int`, then use `long long`.
- Do not use plain `char` or `bool` in arithmetic expressions. Use them _only_ to hold characters or truth values.
- Use `double` for floating-point computations; `float` usually does not have enough precision, and the cost of double-precision calculations versus single-precision is negligible.

# Type conversion
```c++
bool b = 42;            // b is true
int i = b;              // i has value 1
i = 3.14;               // i has value 3
double pi = i;          // pi has value 3.0
unsigned char c = -1;   // assuming 8-bit chars, c has value 255
signed char c2 = 256;   // assuming 8-bit chars, the value of c2 is undefined
```
