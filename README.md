# IT603-notes

## Course objective
Course is designed as a first timer introduction to programming. It assumes no prior exposure to programming. Course aims at imparting students solid understanding of not only programming language features but also fundamentals knowledge that" transferable to other languages alsoÂ 

## Course outcome
After taking this course, students will be able to write portable, efficient application programs in C++. They will also be able to navigate Linux environments fluently and take up new programming languages with relative ease.
